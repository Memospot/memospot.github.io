# About

[Memospot](https://github.com/lincolnthalles/memospot) is a self-contained desktop version of [Memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos), a beautiful, privacy-first, lightweight note-taking service.

This project is designed for people who:

- Are new to Docker
- Prefer not to host Memos themselves
- Wish to run Memos on their local machine with no Docker overhead
- Are interested in testing Memos before spinning up a Docker instance.

## Key features

- Easy to install and use
- Bundled Memos server build, based on official release tags
- Automated server startup and shutdown
- Internal Memos server listens only on localhost, at a random port

## Requirements

- Windows 10, macOS, or Linux
- System WebView (Edge, Safari, or WebkitGTK).

> On Windows, you will be prompted to install WebView2, if it's not available.

## Installation

Download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/lincolnthalles/memospot/releases).

> - On Windows, you may get a warning from Windows Defender SmartScreen. This is because the app is not signed.
>   Just click `More info` and `Run anyway`.
> - On macOS, you may need to [allow the app to run](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac) first.

## Data Portability {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

If you plan to move your Memos instance to Docker in the future, keep the object storage setting at the default option `Database` for a drop-in migration. Just move `memos_prod.db` to the Docker volume and that's it.

Although, if you are storing huge files, it's a good idea to use `Local Storage` instead, even with this trade-off.

> If you ever need to do a Memos migration, check [Data Migration](MIGRATION.md).
